# Face-Recognition-System_Updated
STEPS:

1)Capture positive and anchor images from webcam into data folder.

2)Extract negative images from lfw dataset.

3)Splitting data into train and test split.

4)Applying Siamese neural network and facenet algorithm for face similarity match for facial recognition(identification) and verification purpose.

5)Creating the Model.

6)Creating object file for the model.

NOTE :

   * Use Demo.ipynb file.

üìù Description

Face recognition system using siamese neural network and facenet for facial recognition(identification) and verification purpose.

‚è≥ Dataset

Download the lfw(negative images)dataset from :http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/

Download Project Zip file from : https://github.com/Namrata2615/SPAM-HAM-CLASSIFIER

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Python 3.9.7

üìñ Instructions to run

*Zip file can also be downloaded and run on anaconda prompt.

*Then open the file location after activating the environment on anaconda prompt.

*Open Jupyter Notebook to run the code.

üéØNOTE

1)This project is just a demo on the face captured for anchor and positive images and images extracted from lfw dataset.

2)While running the zip file if any difficulty is found like library is not installed , just type pip install(library name) command on anaconda prompt under same environment.

3)For other commands on anaconda prompt - can google it.
